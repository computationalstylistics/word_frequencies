# Improving word frequencies

Data and code needed to replicate the study on improving the performance of word frequencies:

A shorter version of this study will also be presented (virtually) at DH2022 conference in Tokyo, and the paper will likely appear in the book of abstract there.

The experiments conducted in this study rely on a corpus of 100 English novels, available freely from this repository: [https://github.com/computationalstylistics/100_english_novels](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/100_english_novels). Also, a word vector model used to retrieve relevant word similarities can be found there. The code to replicate the experiments is listed in the file [`code_for_improved_frequencies.md`](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/word_frequencies/blob/main/code_for_improved_frequencies.md) below.

Since it takes some time to complete all the computations, the final results, together with the final plots, are also posted in the current directory, in the folders `results` and `final_plots`, respectively.

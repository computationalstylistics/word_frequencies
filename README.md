Preprint version on arXiv: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01289](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01289)

A shorter version of this study was also be presented at DH2022 conference in Tokyo, and the paper should be available in the book of abstracts there.

The experiments conducted in this study rely on a corpus of 100 English novels, available freely from this repository: [https://github.com/computationalstylistics/100_english_novels](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/100_english_novels). Also, a word vector model used to retrieve relevant word similarities can be found there. The code to replicate the experiments is listed in the file [`code_for_improved_frequencies.md`](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/word_frequencies/blob/main/code_for_improved_frequencies.md) below.

Since it takes some time to complete all the computations, the final results, together with the final plots, are also posted in the current directory, in the folders `results` and `final_plots`, respectively.
